### Conclusion

For DFW service businesses, the question isn't whether to implement speed-to-lead automation, but how quickly you can deploy it before your competitors do. The businesses leading in this space today are those that adopted AI voice agents in 2024 and have gained significant market share during the transition period.

The speed-to-lead advantage will diminish as more businesses adopt AI agents, but for now, early adopters have a significant competitive moat that's difficult for competitors to close.
